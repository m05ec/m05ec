### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mo, and I am a Cyber Security Expert with over a decade of experience in computer networking and offensive security. Currently, I serve as a pen-tester for a team of offensive security experts, tasked with strengthening companies' security posture with the help of offensive security and venerability management. Here I have 2 types of projects, ones are the bash/python scripts that are gonna automate some tasks that a pentester does to save time. Others are useful softwares that I use on different assesments.
