### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mo, and I am a Cyber Security Expert with over a decade of experience in computer networking and offensive security. Currently, I serve as a pen-tester for a team of offensive security experts, tasked with strengthening companies' security posture with the help of offensive security and venerability management. Here I have mostly bash/python scripts that I wrote to use in my assesments.
